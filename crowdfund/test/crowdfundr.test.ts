// REQUIRED: Instructions
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
  Please note that:

    - The tests provided are about ~90% complete.
    - IMPORTANT:
      - We've intentionally left out some tests that would reveal potential
        vulnerabilities you'll need to identify, solve for, AND TEST FOR!

      - Failing to address these vulnerabilities will leave your contracts
        exposed to hacks, and will certainly result in extra points being
        added to your micro-audit report! (Extra points are _bad_.)

  Your job (in this file):

    - DO NOT delete or change the test names for the tests provided
    - DO complete the testing logic inside each tests' callback function
    - DO add additional tests to test how you're securing your smart contracts
         against potential vulnerabilties you identify as you work through the
         project.

    - You will also find several places where "FILL_ME_IN" has been left for
      you. In those places, delete the "FILL_ME_IN" text, and replace with
      whatever is appropriate.
